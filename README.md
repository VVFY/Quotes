An old pet project in view system with upgraded dependencies, brought back into existence to demonstrate migration to compose.

### Points to note in this branch and in its related MR.
* Add [compose navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation).
* Remove view system navigation and other related dependencies.
* Navigate internally using deeplink is displayed in branch opt/internal-deeplink-navigation just to mimic old navigation from view system, but will not be merged.
